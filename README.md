# Opus GitHub repository

## What is Opus
Opus is a framework for creating visual novel with Unity. It is an open source Unity project, with all basic features you would except in a Visual Novel already taken care of.

It uses simple and extensible XML files to define the structure of the game.

## What Opus is not
Opus is not a "make a visual novel without code" tool. Even if a lot of the heavy lifting is already done, there are still some things you are expected to do yourself. This is because I want Opus to stay simple and barebone while still being extensible.

## Where to start

Coming soon.

## Contributing to Opus

The code is a mess right now (though a functionnal mess), so I am not in favor of adding features until the actual thing is not cleaned up.

There are two scenes in the project, `Title` and `Game`. The main thing is the `VisualNovelManager` script in the `Game` scene, which will read the XML files in the **Resources** folder and make the game progress, so I would suggest beginning here.
